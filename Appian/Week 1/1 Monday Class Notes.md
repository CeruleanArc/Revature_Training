This course on Appian will be taught by **Bharat Kunamneni**.

## Expectations

* Our performance will be reviewed on a weekly basis by either random questions in class or by reviewing the code.
* We will have weekly assessments for all trainees.
* We are expected to finish the exercises assigned to us and to present our screen for code review when our names are randomly called.
* We are expected to study the **Appian Certified Associate Developer** material along with the classroom training material, and passing the certification exam will be our end objective.
* We will be encouraged to form team so that we can mutually help one another, support our development, and study for the Appian Certified Associate Developer certification.
* We will begin preparing notes from Day 1.\

## Study Guide for Appian Training

For each topic assigned, we are expected to organize our notes in a particular manner, which is to aid in training and our own edification:

## Business Process Manager

The **Business Process Manager** or **BPM** is a business process that allows us to organize our thinking surrounding business processes. Often there is software we can use to implement business processes more efficiently.

There are multiple types of BPMs on the market. One of these is **Appian**, which we'll be learning about.

### The Five Stages of BPM

1. **Design:** Break the process down into multiple tasks. Most processes include a form to collect data and a workflow to process it. Build your form and identify who will own each task in the workflow.
2. **Model:** Model it using suitable BPM software. Represent the process in a visual layout. Fix details like deadlines and conditions to give a clear idea of the sequence of event and the flow of data throughout the process.

3. **Execute:** Execute the process, or put a system in place. Execute the process by testing it live with a small group first (alpha testing) and then open it up to all users (beta testing). Make sure you restrict access to sensitive information.
4. **Monitor:** Monitor and analyze the system. Keep an eye on the process as it runs through the workflow. Use the right metrics to identify progress, measure efficiency, and locate bottlenecks.
5. **Optimize:** Make changes to the process to improve it. As you analyze, notice any changes that need to be done to your form or workflow to make them more efficient. Consider business process improvement steps.

## What is Appian?

**Appian** is a low-code automation platform that helps businesses produce workflows and build applications for their business needs.

* Appian helps you build apps and workflows rapidly, with a low-code automation platform. Appian combines people, technologies, and data in a single workflow to maximize your resources and dramatically improve business results.
* Appian is the only recognized global leader across multiple enterprise technology markets, including low-code application development, digital process automation (DPA), intelligent business process management systems (iBPMS), and dynamic case management (DCM).

**Low-Code** means that you can...

* Develop and deploy mission-critical apps 10 times faster.
* Increase your business and IT collaboration by leveraging visual development and reusable components to build and modify robust apps quickly. Tackle even your most complex processes and deliver mobile-native apps on all devices without any additional effort.

**Integrations and data** mean that you can...

* Integrate data from anywhere. Data migration is not required.
* Integrating enterprise data sources doesn't need to be painful. With our low-code data, you can rapidly integrate data from anywhere and eliminate silos. ANd when we say data migration is "not required," we mean it.

Appian helps enterprises achieve...

* 17 times accelerated application development.
* 50% lower development costs.
* $13.42 million in savings over three years.
* 7,800 employee hours saved in one department.
